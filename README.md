# MZ-Review-Carousel

E-Commerce review carousel project

This is a basic review carousel app. The way I see it,
I'll make a form where user can input basic data that
will appear in a carousel after they submit the form.

Things to do:

- create basic structure for the form and carousel
- play with CSS
- implement functionality:
  - store a submitted form (review) in a local storage
  - add navigator buttons to scroll between reviews

Note:
This doesn't include backend so the data is hard-coded
into the form. This obviously leaves space for improvement
in the future with logged user's data being used and
bla bla bla...
